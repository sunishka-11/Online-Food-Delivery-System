# Online-Food-Delivery-System

Abstract:
The Online Food Delivery Management System is a database-driven application that automates food ordering, delivery, and payment management. It integrates MySQL backend with Python GUI (CustomTkinter) for smooth CRUD operations.
 The project demonstrates the use of tables, constraints, triggers, stored procedures, nested queries, and user-defined functions to simulate real-world online delivery platforms like Swiggy and Zomato.
 
Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive and database-driven food delivery management system that streamlines online food ordering, delivery tracking, and payment management.
 It allows customers to place orders, sellers to manage their menus, and delivery partners to fulfill orders efficiently — all stored and managed through a MySQL database backend with a Python GUI frontend.
The project demonstrates key database concepts such as Normalization, Triggers, Stored Procedures, and Functions integrated within a real-world use case. It also enables seamless CRUD operations through a user-friendly interface built using CustomTkinter.

Scope:
-Managing customer records, seller information, products, and delivery partners.
-Processing orders and payments, including automatic transaction generation.
-Providing analytical insights such as customer spending, active orders, and delivery performance.


Generating real-time reports using JOIN queries and aggregate SQL functions.
